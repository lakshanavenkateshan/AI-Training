Day 11 — Attention Is All You Need

Attention Is All You Need is a landmark research paper published in 2017 by Vaswani et al.
The paper introduces the Transformer architecture for sequence modeling.

The key idea is that attention alone is sufficient to model sequences, removing the need for RNNs and CNNs.

The Transformer relies on self-attention to capture relationships between all words in a sentence, enabling effective modeling of long-range dependencies.

It follows an encoder–decoder architecture:

The encoder converts the input sequence into contextual representations.

The decoder generates the output sequence step by step.

The model uses scaled dot-product attention for efficient computation and multi-head attention to learn multiple representation patterns in parallel.

Since Transformers lack recurrence, positional encoding is added to preserve word order information.

Unlike RNN-based models, Transformers support parallel processing, leading to faster training and better scalability.

This architecture became the foundation for modern NLP models such as BERT, GPT, and T5.
