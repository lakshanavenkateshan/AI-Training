BIT CHATBOT
BITRA – Rule-Based AI Assistant for the BIT Website

BITRA is an AI-based virtual assistant developed for the Bannari Amman Institute of Technology to help visitors on the official website.
It mainly handles frequently asked queries related to admissions, courses offered, fee structure, hostel details, and contact information.
The chatbot uses simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques so that it can understand basic English questions typed by users.

BITRA functions as a retrieval-style chatbot, meaning it picks the best response from a fixed set of answers stored in its database.
The system identifies the user’s intent — for example, whether they are asking about admissions, departments, or facilities — and then selects the correct reply.

A structured knowledge base containing college information such as academic programs, departments, campus services, and facilities supports the chatbot.
Its workflow is straightforward: User query → NLP processing → Intent detection → Matching answer → Response displayed.

BITRA helps users quickly find information without browsing through multiple web pages.
It offers 24/7 automated support, which reduces the workload of the college helpdesk and admission team.
Responses are generated using predefined templates to maintain clarity and prevent incorrect answers.

The chatbot is simple to access through the conversation window on the BIT website.
Since BITRA is rule-based, it does not generate new answers like ChatGPT; it only replies using its stored knowledge.
Because of this, it has some limitations — it cannot understand complicated or unusual questions.

Overall, BITRA improves communication on the BIT website by giving fast, reliable, and automated responses to common student and visitor queries.
