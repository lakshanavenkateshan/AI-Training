Polynomial Regression is used when the relationship between input x and output y is curved, not a straight line.

The general equation is:
y = b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2 + b3*x^3 + ... + bn*x^n

Even though the curve is non-linear, it is still called linear regression because the model is linear in terms of its coefficients (b0, b1, b2...).

Polynomial Regression is useful when data shows patterns like:

🔹U-shape
🔹hill shape
🔹waves
🔹curves instead of straight trends

The method works by adding extra feature columns such as:
x^2, x^3, x^4, ...

This helps the model capture bending and curving patterns.

Model behaviour:

🔹If degree is too low → model is too simple → underfitting
🔹If degree is too high → model memorizes noise → overfitting

Where it is commonly used:

🔹Price prediction
🔹Growth curves
🔹Physics experiments
🔹Performance curves
🔹Weather/temperature patterns

Visualization:

🔹Linear regression → straight line
🔹Polynomial regression → smooth bending curve
The model uses the least squares method to find the best coefficients.
Each coefficient tells how much that power of x (x, x^2, x^3...) affects the output y.
